if no cover art found then sound menu will continue to use last found

##FIXED##
Folders with identical names will break the combo box -- fixed by disallowing identical names in add folder window
add radio station dialog sometimes fails with "AttributeError: IconoRadio instance has no attribute 'editPref'" -- seems fixed now.
on load the playmark exists if theres stuff to load, but pressing play starts at the beginning

##Not Bugs Below just Notes##

from gi.repository import Gtk

# You must import GdkX11 for the window.get_xid() method to be present:
from gi.repository import GdkX11

window = Gtk.Window()
drawing = Gtk.DrawingArea()
window.add(drawing)

# Before show_all(), drawing.get_property('window') is None:
window.show_all()
xid = drawing.get_property('window').get_xid()
print('xid =', xid)
